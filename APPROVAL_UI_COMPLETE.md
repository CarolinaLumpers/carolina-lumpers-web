## How to Test

### 1. Start Local Server (Already Running)

In Google Sheets CLS_Hub_Backend → ClockIn sheet:
1. Add a new row with these values:
   - ClockinID: CLK-TEST123
   - WorkerID: (any worker ID, e.g., CLS001)
   - Date: (today's date)
   - Time: (current time)
   - Nearest Client: Test Site
   - Distance (mi): 0.8
   - Latitude: 35.7796
   - Longitude: -78.6382
   - **ApprovalStatus: pending** ← Important!
   - Needs Processing: Yes

2. Save and wait a few seconds

## API Integration

## Browser Console Testing (Alternative Method)

If the UI doesn't work, test APIs directly in browser console:

```javascript
// Test Get Pending
fetch('https://cls-proxy.s-garay.workers.dev?action=getPendingClockIns&requesterId=CLS001')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('Pending:', d));

// Test Approve
fetch('https://cls-proxy.s-garay.workers.dev?action=approveClockIn&clockinId=CLK-TEST123&requesterId=CLS001')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('Approved:', d));

// Test Deny
fetch('https://cls-proxy.s-garay.workers.dev?action=denyClockIn&clockinId=CLK-TEST123&requesterId=CLS001&reason=Test%20denial')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(d => console.log('Denied:', d));
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No pending approvals" but you added test data
- Check ApprovalStatus column value is exactly `pending` (lowercase)
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)

### Buttons don't work
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify you're logged in as Admin or Lead
- Verify workerId is set in localStorage: `localStorage.getItem('CLS_WorkerID')`

### API returns "Unauthorized"
- Check USER_ROLE: `localStorage.getItem('CLS_Role')`
- Must be 'Admin' or 'Lead' (case-sensitive)
- Try re-logging in

### Cards don't appear
- Check Network tab (F12 → Network)
- Look for API call to getPendingClockIns
- Check response data
- Verify JSONP callback is working

### Email not sent
- Check GmailApp quota (backend)
- Verify worker has email in Workers sheet
- Check Apps Script execution logs

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test the UI with real data
2. ✅ Verify email notifications are working
3. ✅ Check Activity_Logs for approval events
4. 🔄 Deploy to production (push to GitHub, Vercel redeploy)
5. 🔄 Add approval deadline feature (optional - 24-hour window)
6. 🔄 Add bulk approve/deny (optional - select multiple)
7. 🔄 Add search/filter by worker (optional)

## Production Deployment

When ready to deploy:

```powershell
# Push to GitHub
cd "$env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\carolina-lumpers-web\carolina-lumpers-web"
git add employeeDashboard.html
git commit -m "Add clock-in approval UI for admin dashboard"
git push origin main

# Or manually upload to GCP bucket
gsutil cp employeeDashboard.html gs://your-bucket-name/
```
