## Integration Points

All new modules would integrate with your core system:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Core System] --> B[Worker Mobile App]
    A --> C[Route Optimization]
    A --> D[Training Module]
    A --> E[Analytics]
    A --> F[Automation]
    A --> G[Equipment Mgmt]
    A --> H[KPI Tracking]
    A --> I[Client Comm]
    A --> J[Supervisor App]
    A --> K[Quality Control]
```

These modules can be built incrementally after your core system migration is complete. Would you like me to detail the implementation plan for any specific module? 🎯
