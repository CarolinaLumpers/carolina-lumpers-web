      <h2>Why Floor-Loaded Freight Is Different ‚Äî And Why We're Built for It</h2>
      <p>Most labor providers avoid floor-loaded freight. We <strong>specialize</strong> in it.</p>
      <p>üì¶ No pallets. No automation. Just raw containers packed wall to wall.<br>
         üõ†Ô∏è It takes <strong>trained teams</strong>, <strong>strategic planning</strong>, and <strong>relentless pace</strong> to do it right.</p>
      <p>At Carolina Lumper Service, we‚Äôve made floor-loaded freight our niche:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>‚úÖ Fast unloads without cutting corners</li>
        <li>‚úÖ Real-time adjustments to shifting loads or damaged freight</li>
        <li>‚úÖ Flat-rate pricing options for predictable cost</li>
        <li>‚úÖ No temps ‚Äî just trained professionals who know the game</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>This isn‚Äôt day labor. This is logistics execution.</strong><br>
         If your warehouse is buried in containers, we‚Äôve got your solution.</p>
