      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>At Carolina Lumper Service (CLS), we provide more than just labor‚Äîwe offer efficiency, reliability, and strategic workforce solutions to keep warehouse operations running at peak performance. Founded in November 2024 by Steve Garay and Daniela Molina, CLS was built on the principle that strong client partnerships lead to better productivity, smoother operations, and long-term success.</p>
      <p>Before launching CLS, Steve Garay co-founded and managed a company specializing in container unloading and warehouse staffing on a national scale. While the business grew quickly, it became clear that expansion often came at the cost of client relationships and operational focus. Recognizing the need for a more personalized, partnership-driven approach, Steve stepped away from the national model to create CLS‚Äîa company dedicated to prioritizing quality service, efficiency, and strong client relationships over rapid expansion.</p>
        <p>With years of experience in logistics, workforce management, and automation, Steve and Dani have built CLS into a trusted provider of high-quality labor solutions, offering flexibility, precision, and accountability to warehouses, distribution centers, and supply chain operations.</p>
