### **QuickBooks Online Integration Plan for Weekly Invoice Automation**

---

### **Objective**

To create a comprehensive system designed to automate the generation of weekly invoices in QuickBooks Online. This system will leverage Google Apps Script as a robust backend tool, facilitating seamless synchronization of data between platforms while requiring minimal manual intervention. The ultimate goal is to streamline invoicing workflows, reduce errors, and save time for users.

### **Revised Modular Plan**

#### **Module 1: Authentication (OAuth 2.0)**

**Objective**: Build a secure and dependable connection between Google Apps Script and QuickBooks Online using OAuth 2.0, ensuring all interactions are authorized and encrypted.

**Process Overview**:

- The system initiates a request for access to QuickBooks data by redirecting users to a secure login page.
- Upon successful authentication, QuickBooks provides the application with an access token. This token is used for subsequent API requests.
- The access token is securely stored within the application’s property store, reducing the need for repeated logins while maintaining high security standards.

**Steps**:

1. Register the application on the QuickBooks Developer Portal and obtain client credentials (completed).
2. Configure the Redirect URI to facilitate communication between QuickBooks’ authentication system and the Google Apps Script web app (completed).
3. Integrate the OAuth2 library into Apps Script, and configure it to:
   - Generate the authorization URL for users to log in securely.
   - Redirect users back to the app upon login success.
   - Store and manage the access token to enable API access.
4. Validate the authentication process by testing the end-to-end flow and ensuring a stable connection to QuickBooks.

#### **Module 2: Fetch Data from QuickBooks**

**Objective**: Efficiently retrieve essential data, such as customer records and product/service details, from QuickBooks Online. This data will serve as foundational inputs for generating accurate invoices.

**Process Overview**:

- Use the access token established in Module 1 to authenticate API requests to QuickBooks endpoints.
- Retrieve and process the data, either storing it in a structured format like Google Sheets or using it directly within the script.
- Ensure the data fetched is accurate, up-to-date, and ready for use in invoice creation workflows.

**Steps**:

1. Develop scripts to interact with QuickBooks API endpoints for:
   - Retrieving customer data, including names, contact details, and account IDs.
   - Fetching product and service information, including descriptions, prices, and IDs.
   - Optionally, retrieving existing invoices for review or validation.
2. Process and format the fetched data to ensure it is easy to read, verify, and utilize for downstream tasks.
3. Log data retrieval operations for auditing and debugging purposes, ensuring transparency and reliability.

#### **Module 3: Create an Invoice in QuickBooks**

**Objective**: Design a script to construct and submit invoices to QuickBooks based on predefined input data, ensuring the process is seamless and error-free.

**Process Overview**:

- Gather all necessary data, including customer IDs, product/service details, quantities, and amounts, from Google Sheets or other data sources.
- Use QuickBooks API to create an invoice, sending the prepared data in the correct format.
- Handle API responses to confirm successful invoice creation or identify and address errors.

**Steps**:

1. Collect and validate all required input data (e.g., customer IDs, product IDs, invoice amounts) from predefined sources.
2. Develop a script to execute the `Create Invoice` API call, formatting the data to meet QuickBooks’ API requirements.
3. Test the script with various data sets to ensure proper invoice creation and accurate error handling.
4. Refine the script to handle edge cases, such as missing data or invalid inputs, ensuring robust performance.

#### **Module 4: Automate Weekly Invoice Creation**

**Objective**: Implement an automated process that generates and submits invoices to QuickBooks on a weekly schedule, based on predefined rules or data maintained in a Google Sheet.

**Process Overview**:

- The script will retrieve weekly task or sales data from Google Sheets and use it to generate invoices.
- The system will ensure consistency by checking for duplicate entries and validating data before submission.
- Automation will minimize manual input, freeing up time for other tasks while maintaining accuracy and reliability.

**Steps**:

1. Create a structured Google Sheet to store:
   - Customer details, including names and QuickBooks IDs.
   - Weekly tasks, hours worked, or sales amounts for invoicing.
2. Develop a script to:
   - Read and process data from the Google Sheet.
   - Generate invoices for each customer by calling the QuickBooks API.
   - Log each operation, including successes and errors, for review and debugging.
3. Set up Google Apps Script triggers to run the invoice generation script on a weekly basis (e.g., every Monday morning).
4. Test the full automation workflow to ensure accuracy, reliability, and proper error handling.

### **Next Steps**

1. Configure the OAuth2 setup in your Apps Script to establish a secure connection with QuickBooks.
2. Deploy the Web App and execute the `doGet` function to initiate the authentication process.
3. Verify the setup by logging into QuickBooks and confirming the reception of an **"Authorization successful!"** message.
4. Proceed to **Module 2: Fetching Data from QuickBooks**, where you’ll build scripts to retrieve and process customer and product data.

Once Modules 1 and 2 are completed, move on to Modules 3 and 4 to implement invoice creation and automation, achieving a streamlined weekly invoicing system.
