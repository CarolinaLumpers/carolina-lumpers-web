### **Module 1: Authentication (OAuth 2.0)**

---

### **Objective**
The goal of this module is to establish a secure, reliable, and seamless connection between Google Apps Script and QuickBooks Online using OAuth 2.0 protocols. This ensures that all interactions are securely authorized, encrypted, and designed for efficient and long-term use. Through this process, the app will request, store, and manage access tokens to facilitate API communication while maintaining robust security standards. 🔒🔑📡

---

### **Overview of Process**
1. The application initiates a request to QuickBooks for permission to access user data by redirecting the user to a secure login page hosted by QuickBooks.
2. Upon successful login and user authorization, QuickBooks generates an access token and sends it back to the application via the predefined redirect URI.
3. The access token, which serves as the key to accessing QuickBooks APIs, is securely stored in the Google Apps Script environment and reused for future requests until it expires. This minimizes the need for repeated logins and ensures a streamlined process. 🔄🔒🛡️

### **Detailed Action Items**

#### **1. Register the Application in QuickBooks Developer Portal**
- **Action**: Ensure that the app is properly registered within the QuickBooks Developer Portal with all required details, including its purpose and functionality. 📝🖥️✅
- **Steps**:
  - Log in to the [QuickBooks Developer Portal](https://developer.intuit.com/).
  - Create a new app, specifying the environment (Sandbox for testing or Production for live use).
  - Configure the app settings, including adding the Redirect URI for the Apps Script Web App.
  - Retrieve the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, essential credentials for establishing the OAuth2 connection.
- **Expectations**:
  - The app is successfully registered and configured with the correct permissions.
  - The Client ID and Client Secret are securely stored for use in the Apps Script configuration. 🔑💾📋

#### **2. Add OAuth2 Library to Apps Script**
- **Action**: Integrate the OAuth2 library to manage the authentication flow. 📚💻🔗
- **Steps**:
  - Open your Apps Script project and navigate to **Extensions > Libraries**.
  - Search for the OAuth2 library using the script ID: `1B8cMs8loXoHP4d4UeoL9bAp7zFks5f6OnBQ3PZvjrfFAIZcSmfJuG4ZD`.
  - Add the library and ensure it is included in your project dependencies.
- **Expectations**:
  - The library is successfully added and functional within the script.
  - Necessary configurations for the OAuth2 service are completed, ensuring compatibility with QuickBooks. 🔗⚙️✅

#### **3. Configure OAuth2 Service in Apps Script**
- **Action**: Write a function to define the OAuth2 service with all required parameters. 🛠️📜⚙️
- **Steps**:
  - Create a new function in Apps Script to set up the OAuth2 service.
  - Include the following configurations:
    - Authorization Base URL: `https://appcenter.intuit.com/connect/oauth2`
    - Token URL: `https://oauth.platform.intuit.com/oauth2/v1/tokens/bearer`
    - Scope: `com.intuit.quickbooks.accounting` (to enable API access for accounting tasks).
    - Redirect URI matching the one registered in the Developer Portal.
  - Implement error handling for scenarios such as token retrieval failures or invalid credentials.
- **Expectations**:
  - The OAuth2 service is fully configured and ready for secure communication with QuickBooks.
  - Any errors during token retrieval are handled gracefully and logged for debugging. 🔐✅🛡️

#### **4. Implement Authorization Flow**
- **Action**: Create a function that generates the QuickBooks authorization link for users to log in and grant access. 🔗🔑👤
- **Steps**:
  - Define a `doGet` function that creates and returns an authorization URL.
  - Include the logic to redirect users to the QuickBooks login page.
  - Display the link or embed it in an HTML interface for easy user interaction.
- **Expectations**:
  - The authorization link directs users to the secure QuickBooks login page.
  - Users can log in and grant access without encountering errors. 🖥️✅👥

#### **5. Handle Callback from QuickBooks**
- **Action**: Develop a callback function to process the response from QuickBooks after the user logs in and grants permissions. 🔄📨🔒
- **Steps**:
  - Define an `authCallback` function to capture the response sent by QuickBooks.
  - Extract the access token from the response and securely store it using `PropertiesService`.
  - Log success or failure messages for tracking and debugging purposes.
- **Expectations**:
  - The callback function processes the response efficiently and securely stores tokens for future use.
  - Errors during token processing are logged and resolved promptly. 📋✅⚡

#### **6. Test Authentication Process**
- **Action**: Deploy the script as a Web App and validate the entire authentication workflow. 🔗🧪🔍
- **Steps**:
  - Publish the Apps Script project as a Web App and obtain the deployment URL.
  - Access the Web App, generate the authorization link, and complete the login process.
  - Verify that the message "Authorization successful!" appears upon successful flow completion.
- **Expectations**:
  - The authentication flow works seamlessly, enabling secure access to QuickBooks APIs.
  - Tokens are correctly stored and ready for use in subsequent API requests. 🎉✅🔒
